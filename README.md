# Face-Recognition-by-python
This code is about image recognition, so you can use it to recognize other than human face and the code that's from my class.

## Feature Extraction (now)
  - Eigenvector (from PCA)
  - Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)

## Image Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## How to use this code
  ### Training
  Change path from original to what you want. This path should be your dataset and beware about overfitting.
  ### Testing 
  Copy your picture path to path parameter. This path supports all Except!!!!! .GIF (That's all about I know).
